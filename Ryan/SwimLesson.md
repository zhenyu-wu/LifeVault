## Basics

### Breaststroke

#### Hand strokes

Breaststroke hand stroke hand movement consists of four phases: 
- Catch (out-sweep): start in a streamline, arms pull outward 
	-  From full extension, hands separate into slightly wider than shoulder-width with palms facing outward and slightly downward, keeping elbows high
- Pull / In-sweep: sweep inward under the chin (pull / in-sweep) to generate forward momentum
	- Hands  sweep inward and backward, creating a "scooping" motion under the chest / chin, which provides the primary propulsion.
- Recovery: rapidly shoot forward  into a glide
	- Hands and arms are pushed forward from under the chest back to the starting, streamlined position. 
- Glide: the final, momentary phase of holding the streamline position before the next stroke.
The motion is often described as "pull, breath, kick, glide"
##### Important Tips 
- Timing: the kick occurs during the recovery phase, while the head lifts to breath during the pull / in-sweep.
- The stroke begins slowly and accelerate through the in-sweep, while the recovery should be quick to minimize the drag. 

### Butterfly

#### Hand strokes

Butterfly stroke hand movement consists of four main phases:
- Entry & Catch (out-sweep)
	-  Hands enter the water thumb-first, roughly shoulder-width apart
		- thumbs or palms face slightly outward to initiate a quick catch
	- Establish a strong "catch" by pressing the hands down and out (out-sweep) to form a Y-shape
	- This phase is synchronized with 1st dolphin kick of  the cycle
-  Pull (down-sweep)
	-  Hands sweep outward and then back toward the center of the body
	- Maintain a high elbow position, keeping the forearms vertical to maximize water resistance for propulsion
	- The hands move in a semi-circle towards the middle, ending roughly under the chest or chin
- Push (Up-sweep)
	- Hands accelerate backwards from the chest towards the hips
	- This is the most propulsive part of the stroke, where the hands reach their maximum speed
	- 2nd dolphin kick occurs during the end of this phase to help propel the shoulder out of the water
- Recovery 
	- arms are swung simultaneously over the water surface to the staring position  
	- The recovery should be ballistic and relaxed, using momentum from the push phase to "throw" the arms forward with straight or slightly bent elbows. 
	- Hands exit the water pinky-first or with palms facing outwards.
##### Important Tips
- Key to efficiency is accelerating the hand speed through the pull; keeping the elbows high; and using the momentum to lift arms over the water 

## Lessons
### 20260208

Backstroke Finish
- Butterfly kick
- Eyes go back to look at the wall (not to the side)
- Count strokes towards the wall (5 for yards pool, 6 for meter pool)

Breaststroke
-  Work on how to make go forward 
- Faster in-sweep stroke to life the body up to generate forward momentum. 
- When getting tired, trick the brain to go faster

Butterfly
- Hands (current problem @ 29'30"): hand positioning
	- During the recovery, thumbs face down and palms face backwards
	- Push the water back hard, use the body strength to quickly move the arms forward
- Need to snap the feet down and up quick, don't kick above the water
- When lift to breath, just keep the chin above the surface
- Use 6 fast underwater kicks to pull out

Freestyle 
- Flip turn
	- Must be in streamline position before hitting the wall
	- Plant the two feet firmly on the wall before pushing it off
- Head position too high 
	- When rotate to breath, still keep forehead down 
	- Catchup drill

Jump Dive
- Not able to do that because the platforms at the NAC pool are not standard with side bars
