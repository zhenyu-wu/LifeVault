###### The Point of Retirement? Enlightenment, or at Least Calm (WSJ 20160110, C4)

But he would also tell you that retirement is about getting ready to die. To the Dalai Lama, all of life should contain some preparation for death, but that preparation should become more important in the last phase.

According to the Dalai Lama, you want to leave the world in as calm and composed a way as possible. You want to be fully present at your own passing, with a mind clear and, if possible, not clouded by medications. You want to do all you can to move beyond the very human fear of death and get as close to tranquility as you can. You can do this through meditation. While you meditate you brood on the impermanence of all things, including yourself, and envision yourself as a corpse, lying out on a bier, all life gone. This will happen. It’s inevitable.

Hindus commend a phase of life that they call Sanyassa. In it, an elderly person gives up ownership of worldly possessions. He (usually it is a male but not always) leaves home, puts on a saffron robe, picks up a staff and a beggar’s bowl and begins a life of wandering. He puts aside distractions so he can focus on the life of his spirit and the prospect of death.

If I’m still churning away in my professional life, it will be hard, maybe impossible, to prepare for what is coming. It may seem noble never to retire from work and think about the end, but doing so may make you panic when the prospect of the end becomes manifest, especially if you feel it has come too soon. And who wouldn’t feel that way? Montaigne said that everyone believes he has ten years left to live, no matter how dire his condition. But death comes when it will.

Why does it matter if we go out calmly or kicking and squalling? The Dalai Lama believes that it will be easier to bear if we pass calmly to the next life and if death does not take us completely by surprise. There will be less pain for us overall. Less suffering. As dramatic rehearsals make the play easier to perform, rehearsing our end might make it smoother.

There’s also the effect we have on the people who love us and whom we love. No one wants to be remembered as a ranting, near mad man or woman, though on a certain level there is plenty of reason to rail against death.

##### Stoicism

Stoicism is an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy focused on living a virtuous, rational life by developing inner strength, focusing on what you control (your reactions), and accepting what you cannot, aiming for `eudaimonia` (flourishing) through wisdom, justice, courage and self-discipline, finding tranquility amidst adversity by aligning with nature's reason. It teaches that external events don't cause suffering, but rather our judgments about them, making self-control and character the key to happiness. 

**Core Principles and Beliefs**
-  Virtue is the sole good: wisdom, justice courage and temperance (self-control) are the path to a good life. 
-  Dichotomy of Control: focus energy on your own throughs, action and character; accept external events (health, reputation, wealth) with equanimity. 
-  Living in accordance with nature: understand the universe operates by reason (Logos) and align your rational will with this cosmic order. 
-  Tranquility: achieve inner peace by managing destructive emotions through reason and understanding. 
-  Love of Fate: embrace and accept everything that happens as necessary and as an opportunity for growth. 

**Key Practice**
-  Negative visualization:  contemplating potential losses to appreciate what you have. 
- Objective representation: seeing things as they are, without adding emotional judgment. 
- Dichotomy of Control Exercises: daily reflection on what you can and cannot control. 
-  Virtue ethics: viewing every situation as a chance to practice courage, justice, wisdom or temperance. 

**Famous Stoics**
-  Zeno of Citium: founder  of Stoicism
-  Seneca: Roman statesman, playwright and philosopher
-  Epictetus: former slave, influential teacher
- Marcus Aurelius: Roman emperor, author of Meditations

**Roman Names**

*cognomen* was the 3rd name of a citizen of ancient Rome, often developed to distinguish branches of the family from one another and occasionally to highlight an individual's achievement, typically in warfare. 

For those who already bore a *cognomen*,  *agnomen* was awarded as another exclusive name.  

For eight decades, no Roman emperor had a legitimate son to make heir, and the new circumstance forced a difficult choice on Marcus. Selective adoption had served the empire extremely well, producing a run of sound rulers that has come to be known as the Five Good Emperors.
