###### The Point of Retirement? Enlightenment, or at Least Calm (WSJ 20160110, C4)

But he would also tell you that retirement is about getting ready to die. To the Dalai Lama, all of life should contain some preparation for death, but that preparation should become more important in the last phase.

According to the Dalai Lama, you want to leave the world in as calm and composed a way as possible. You want to be fully present at your own passing, with a mind clear and, if possible, not clouded by medications. You want to do all you can to move beyond the very human fear of death and get as close to tranquility as you can. You can do this through meditation. While you meditate you brood on the impermanence of all things, including yourself, and envision yourself as a corpse, lying out on a bier, all life gone. This will happen. It’s inevitable.

Hindus commend a phase of life that they call Sanyassa. In it, an elderly person gives up ownership of worldly possessions. He (usually it is a male but not always) leaves home, puts on a saffron robe, picks up a staff and a beggar’s bowl and begins a life of wandering. He puts aside distractions so he can focus on the life of his spirit and the prospect of death.

If I’m still churning away in my professional life, it will be hard, maybe impossible, to prepare for what is coming. It may seem noble never to retire from work and think about the end, but doing so may make you panic when the prospect of the end becomes manifest, especially if you feel it has come too soon. And who wouldn’t feel that way? Montaigne said that everyone believes he has ten years left to live, no matter how dire his condition. But death comes when it will.

Why does it matter if we go out calmly or kicking and squalling? The Dalai Lama believes that it will be easier to bear if we pass calmly to the next life and if death does not take us completely by surprise. There will be less pain for us overall. Less suffering. As dramatic rehearsals make the play easier to perform, rehearsing our end might make it smoother.

There’s also the effect we have on the people who love us and whom we love. No one wants to be remembered as a ranting, near mad man or woman, though on a certain level there is plenty of reason to rail against death.
