##### US Treasury I / EE Bonds

When cashing U.S. Treasury I bonds and rolling the proceeds into a Coverdell ESA, the interest can be tax-free if used for qualified education expenses. This should be reported on Form 8815 (Exclusion of Interest From Series EE and I Savings Bonds) with a tax return. 

- Redeem US I bonds
- Deposit the redemption proceeds (principal + interest) into Coverdell within 60 days (or directly from the Treasury, if available)
- Attach Form 8815 to the tax return to claim the educational exclusion on the interest portion.
