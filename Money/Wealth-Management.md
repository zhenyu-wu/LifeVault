[Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/embed/c52YcW1Aut4) to various kinds of retirement accounts
##### The "Buy, Borrow and Die" (BBD) Principle

BBD is a wealthy tax-avoidance strategy, where individuals buy appreciating assets  (stocks, real estate, art), borrow money against them for living expenses (avoiding immediate capital gains tax), and hold the assets until death, passing them to heirs who receive a "step-up in basis," allowing them to sell the assets tax-free for their appreciated value, often settling the debt and retaining significant wealth across generations. It leverages tax rules, particularly the step-up in basis at death, to defer and minimize taxes on massive wealth accumulation.

How It Works: 
- Buy: acquire assets expected to grow significantly in value, like stocks, real estate or collectibles, without selling them to realize a taxable gain. 
- Borrow: take out loans (e.g. securities-backed lines of credit) using these appreciating assets as collateral, providing tax-free cash for living expenses. 
- Die: upon death, the heirs inherit the assets at their fair market values (the "stepped-up basis") rather than the original purchase price, meaning they pay no capital gains tax on the appreciation up to that point. The estate or heirs typically use some of the stepped-up assets to pay off the outstanding loans. 

##### "Substantially Equal Periodic Payment" (SEPPs)

SEPPs allow individuals to withdraw funds from retirement accounts before 59.5 without the standard $10$% early withdrawal penalty under IRS Rule. 
- It involves setting up regular, equal withdrawals using one of the three methods (RMD, amortization, annuitization) and sticking to the schedule precisely. 
- Payment must last for at least 5 years or until you turn 59.5, whichever is longer 
It is ideal for those leaving the workforce early with significant 401K balances who need consistent income before age 59.5.

##### [Roth IRA Conversion / Backdoor IRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDw7MtRKcYY)

Conversion / rollover allows cash or stocks
- For stocks, e.g. consider those that are depressed for the rollover. 
Conversion may impact Medicare
- Income related monthly adjustment amount 
- Conversion may increase your adjustment amount, and thus increases the Medicare Part B or Part D premium. 
Conversion may also impact your social security benefits
- Some of you have to pay federal income taxes on your Social Security benefits. This usually happens only if you have other substantial income in addition to your benefits.
	-  Wages, self-employment, interest, dividends and other taxable income 

##### After-Tax 401K

Three $401$K Accounts: Pre-Tax / Roth / After-Tax 
Defined Contribution Limit (DCL) ~ $70K (three accounts combined)
Roth-conversion
- Convert / rollover funds from After-Tax account to Roth ASAP without appreciation to avoid tax.
	-  Earning in After-Tax account is taxable
- Roth fund grows without tax.

The key choice is between EE's guaranteed doubling for simplicity versus I's inflation-adjusted flexibility.
