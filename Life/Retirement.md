##### The Retirement Crisis No One Warns You about: Mattering (WSJ 20260117 C1)

Many life transitions—retirement, widowhood, divorce, empty nesting— come with an unexpected loss of social anchors ... For retirees, it was an erosion in something far more fundamental - their sense of mattering, the deep human need to feel valued and to have a chance to add value to the world. We plan for our wealth-span and health-span, mapping out financial security and physical well-being. Yet very few of us prepare for an equally essential dimension of retirement: our mattering span, or how we will contribute to fee seen, useful and capable of making a difference in this next chapter of life. 

To understand how to deal with the problem, it’s useful to think of mattering as having four main components, captured in the acronym SAID: feeling significant (seen and essential), appreciated
(valued for your contributions), invested in (supported and cared for) and depended on (needed by others).

... But purpose alone doesn't capture the whole picture. What retirees often search for is the experience of being depend on. The sense of being needed tended to follow a simple, repeatable pattern: They identified a genuine need and met it with 3Ts - time, talent or treasure.
