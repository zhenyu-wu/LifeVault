*Righteous* is giving someone what he deserves
*Grace* is getting something you don’t deserve.
- Because we are sinners, we don’t deserve to come into God’s presence and be called His children. We don’t deserve His blessings and Holy Spirit. But through our faith in Jesus, we receive all of these things. We receive grace.
*Mercy* is not getting what you do deserve.
- Because we are sinners, we deserve death. However, as we call on the name of Jesus and make Him our Lord and Savior, we do not get the death that we justly deserve. We receive mercy.
- Forgiveness
- Judgement: mercy triumphs over judgement
