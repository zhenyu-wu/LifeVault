Users of Claude Code, Anthropic's software-writing AI system, recently discovered a way to create finished, bug-free programs without human intervention. The trick: write a small program that asks the AI, over and over again,  to improve the code it has already written. Named the Ralph Wiggum technique, after the dimwitted but persistently optimistic "Simpsons" character, the simple trick is effective at forcing the Claude Code to solve problems on its own.  

Many people building with AI are finding that fusing several AI models can yield capabilities well beyond those of a single one. Meta is pursuing Manus, which makes a software “agent” that can produce deeply researched reports and perform other actions online. While Meta has its own AI models, Manus uses a combination, including those from Anthropic and others.
