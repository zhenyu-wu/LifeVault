Users of Claude Code, Anthropic's software-writing AI system, recently discovered a way to create finished, bug-free programs without human intervention. The trick: write a small program that asks the AI, over and over again,  to improve the code it has already written. Named the Ralph Wiggum technique, after the dimwitted but persistently optimistic "Simpsons" character, the simple trick is effective at forcing the Claude Code to solve problems on its own.  

Many people building with AI are finding that fusing several AI models can yield capabilities well beyond those of a single one. Meta is pursuing Manus, which makes a software “agent” that can produce deeply researched reports and perform other actions online. While Meta has its own AI models, Manus uses a combination, including those from Anthropic and others. 

Nvidia's GPU dominated the initial push to train AI models. But companies like `Furiosa` are betting that for the next stage - referred to as "inference", or using AI models after they are trained - their specialty chips can be competitive ... `Furiosa` makes chips called NPU, which are a rising class of chips designed specifically to handle the type of computing calculations underpinning AI and use less energy than GPUs (01/03/2026). 

##### Four New Jobs that May be in Future of AI (WSJ 20261012 A13)

1. The Explainer
	- An expert who understands the technology deeply and can translate it into plain language for managers, judges regulators and others. 
2. The Chooser
	- There are different varieties of AI and an AI chooser will help clear possible confusion. This expert will help companies sort through the variety of AI systems available and figure out what jobs they are each best suited to handle. Then the chooser will guide the company through the process of buying and installing the tech.
3. Auditor and Cleaners
	-  They would work hand in hand to spot and resolve problems like bias in AI decisions. The AI auditor, for instance, would perform regular checkups to see if the AI systems produced results that were unfairly skewed in some direction.  The cleaner would adjust the system to eliminate those problems, such as training it with a new set of data that helps eliminates its bias.
4. The Trainer
	- As AI works its way further into people's jobs, workers are going to need lots of training. A new breed of training specialist will leverage AI itself to upskill workers. The trainer would use the technology to figure out what teaching style works best for individuals and tailor the lessons to fit.
