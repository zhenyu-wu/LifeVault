#### How to Win People Over
- Seek status is not a bad thing, it is a normal human need. But we need to do it in the right way. The key is to achieve the two dimensions: (1) assertiveness and (2) caring for others at the same time. 
- When promoting yourself, don't forget to praise others. 
- Help others in the way that is unique to you, form bonds with others that are unique to you. 
- Promote yourself but in some humorous way.

Oversharing isn't alway wise, but in the right contexts -- especially among people who already hold power -- revealing something real about yourself can unlock a deeper level of trust. And that night at the conference taught me something counterintuitive about the professional credibility: among people who already have status, polish is cheap. Vulnerability is informative. 

In my case, the confession didn't make me look careless or unserious. It made me human. It signaled a kind of confidence and a willingness to take social risks -- qualities that matter far more for long-term collaboration than flawless self-presentation.
